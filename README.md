# 👋 Hi there, I'm Inayet!

I'm a tech enthusiast from Denver, CO, passionate about exploring new tools and technologies. Recently, I've been immersing myself in the realms of cutting-edge AI and the declarative world of NixOS. While I may not be an expert yet, I'm thoroughly enjoying the journey of learning and experimentation. 😄

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

* **NixOS & Nix** – Delving into the Nix ecosystem, including NixOS, nixpkgs, and flakes. I'm fascinated by the ability to declare entire system configurations and achieve reproducible development environments. Breaking and fixing setups is all part of the learning process! ❄️

* **AI & LLMs** – Exploring artificial intelligence and large language models. I'm experimenting with APIs for AI applications, such as GPT-style chatbots, and discovering innovative ways to integrate them into projects. The AI field evolves rapidly, and I'm eager to keep pace (or at least try to)! 🤖

* **APIs & Webhooks** – Enjoying the process of connecting services through APIs. I work on projects that integrate various platforms, building webhooks, crafting endpoints, and linking applications together. Fun fact: I run a project called Dreams API, aimed at simplifying integrations. 🌟


## 📚 Tools I’m Learning

* **DSPy** – A declarative framework for programming (rather than prompting) language models, letting you build modular AI systems with composable Python code instead of brittle strings ([GitHub][1], [DSPy][2])
* **DSPyGen** – A Rails-style CLI that scaffolds DSPy modules and AI pipelines, ideal for experimenting with code generation patterns ([GitHub][3])
* **flake-parts** – A minimal mirror of the Nix flake schema providing a module system to refactor and share flake outputs declaratively ([flake.parts][4], [Nix Community][5], [Clan][6], [NixOS Discourse][7], [flake.parts][8], [NixOS Discourse][9], [vtimofeenko.com][10])

Curiosity drives me to learn through hands-on experience. Each day presents an opportunity to acquire new knowledge or deepen existing understanding. I value the open-source community for its wealth of shared knowledge and am always eager to contribute and collaborate.

If you have suggestions, are interested in collaborating on a project, or simply want to discuss tech, feel free to reach out. Whether you're a Nix expert, an AI researcher, or just embarking on your tech journey, I'm always open to conversations and knowledge-sharing. 😊🤝
